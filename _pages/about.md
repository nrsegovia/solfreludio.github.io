I started my undergrad. studies back on 2016 at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) and graduated on 2020 by presenting a thesis on Period Change Rates of `Classical Cepheids` in the Large Magellanic Cloud (paper in prep.) with [Prof. Marcio Catelan](https://www.astro.puc.cl/~mcatelan/){:target="\_blank"} as my advisor. Then, in 2021 I joined UNSW Canberra for a PhD in Physics under the supervision of [Dr. Ashley Ruiter](https://ashleyruiterastro.wordpress.com/){:target="\_blank"}, in which I will be studying binary systems where one (or both) components are `White Dwarf(s)`. Additional experience includes a short summer-research at PUC under Prof. Franz Bauer (AGN-related) and a summer internship at ESO Chile under Dr. Claudia Paladini (Interferometry by using the MATISSE instrument).  My academic interests include (but are not limited to) time domain astronomy (pulsating stars, cataclysmic stars, AGNs, etc), multi-messenger astronomy, big data, machine learning and programming.

On my free time I enjoy playing videogames (including [Mass Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect){:target="\_blank"}, part of the reason why I got into astronomy and astrophysics), reading webcomics and practicing/learning the Korean language (안녕하세요! 독학해서 일상대화 밖에 못하지만 계속 배우고 있어요!).
