Collaboration with Prof. MÃ¡rcio Catelan, his group and the DECAT consortium. By using images from the regular program in addition to a short cadence run (ShoCd, P.I. Catelan), we are both searching for new variables and studying known pulsators, such as delta Scuti and RR Lyrae stars. Particularly, I have been involved in data proccessing (image reduction, creation of catalogs and writing scripts to generate lightcurves) and casually searching for new variables in the deep drilling fields of the program.

Our work is part of the science products and hence has been included in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/519/3/3881/6835526">M. Graham et al. 2023</a>, specifically section 4.4.
