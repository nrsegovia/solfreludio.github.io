I finally managed to make some time for some long-needed updates to my website, after no changes for almost two years.

#### Updates
<ul>
    <li>Projects page</li>
    <li>Removed unnecessary stuff</li>
    <li>Picture</li>
    <li>Cleaned up the blog section</li>
    <li>Publications page</li>
</ul>

I have been wondering whether Spanish and/or Korean versions of the website would be necessary, but so far the English one feels like it is enough.
