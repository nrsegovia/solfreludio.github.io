 <a href="https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS">Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics and Statistics (COMPAS)</a> combines tools for statistical analysis and model selection with rapid population synthesis, allowing inferences to be made about the details of stellar and binary evolution. The code was initially written in order to explore the astrophysical implications of gravitational-wave observations. Gravitational waves are emitted during mergers of double compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), and are now detected regularly by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration. 
 
Considering the detection sensitivity available at the moment, COMPAS has historically been focused on products and effects of massive star's remnants, and therefore had not been properly developed for studying the less massive white dwarf (WD) stars. Under these circumstances, I started developing a prescription for accretion into WDs and fixing/improving the previously available methods. The latest version of the code should have my contribution to the code, ready to be tested and further improved.

I also plan on continuing the use of COMPAS for my research, as well as helping to write and improve the code when possible.
