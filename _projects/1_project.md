This project started back on 2019 as an assignment for the 'Variable Stars' subject dictated by Prof. Marcio Catelan. I participated actively into data acquisition and analysis, which led me to continue the project as part of both the 'Experimental Astrophysics' class and my undergraduate thesis.

A paper has been <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/509/2/2885/6424945">published</a> in MNRAS and the abstract reads as follows:
<blockquote>
The period-change rate (PCR) of pulsating variable stars is a useful probe of changes in their interior structure, and thus of their evolutionary stages. So far, the PCRs of Classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have been explored in a limited sample of the total population of these variables. Here we use a template-based method to derive PCRs for these stars, by taking advantage of the long time baseline afforded by the Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) light curves, combined with additional data from the Optical  Gravitational  Lensing  Experiment  (OGLE),  the  MAssive  Compact  Halo  Object  (MACHO)  project, Gaiaâ€™s Data Release 2, and in some cases the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS). From an initial sample of 2315 sources, our method provides an unprecedented sample of 1303 LMC Classical Cepheids with accurate PCRs, the largest for any single galaxy, including the Milky Way.  Our results include values that are largely compatible with theoretically expected PCRs, as computed by our team using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, as well as with similar previous computations available in the literature. Additionally, five long-period (P >50 d) sources display a cyclic behavior in their O-C diagrams, which is clearly incompatible with evolutionary changes.  Finally, on the basis of their large positive PCR values, two first-crossing Cepheid candidates are identified.
</blockquote>
My favourite part of this project was to identify Cepheids (potentially) crossing the instability strip, which is pretty hard to witness as the timescale of this event is much shorter (we are talking about the <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095933481">Hertzsprung gap</a> stage of stellar evolution) when compared to the second or third crossings.

    Fig. 2 from the article. Top and middle panels show the first crossing candidates, OGLE-LMC-CEP-2840 and OGLE-LMC-CEP-2132: the left row corresponds to the changes of period through time, the middle row shows what happens to the light curve if we ignore the changes, while the right row gives the final results after taking account period changes. The bottom panels depict the improvement in folding the photometric plate-based lightcurve for OGLE-LMC-CEP-2132.
