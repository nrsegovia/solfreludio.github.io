This project was initially conceived as a way to identify similariies and differences in the algorithm (and output) of various population synthesis codes, considering that they are useful tools to study the expected population of compact objects that would potentially become gravitational wave sorces for LISA.

I'm currently involved in this project as the represenative/contact peron from the COMPAS community.
