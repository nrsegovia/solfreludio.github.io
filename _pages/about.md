I started my undergrad. studies back on 2016 at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) and graduated on 2020 by presenting a thesis on Period Change Rates of `Classical Cepheids` in the Large Magellanic Cloud with [Prof. Marcio Catelan](https://www.astro.puc.cl/~mcatelan/){:target="\_blank"} as my advisor. Then, in 2021 I joined UNSW Canberra for a PhD in Physics under the supervision of [Dr. Ashley Ruiter](https://ashleyruiterastro.wordpress.com/){:target="\_blank"}, in which I am working with binary systems involving both white dwarf and sub-dwarf B stars. Additional experience includes a short summer-research at PUC under Prof. Franz Bauer (AGN-related) and a summer internship at ESO Chile under Dr. Claudia Paladini (Interferometry by using the MATISSE instrument). I have participated as a speaker in both ANITA 2022 and 2023, while also being involved in multiple side-projects (check my projects section for more info.). My academic interests include (but are not limited to) time domain astronomy (pulsating stars, cataclysmic stars, AGNs, etc), multi-messenger astronomy, big data, machine learning and programming.

On my free time I play videogames casually ([Mass Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect){:target="\_blank"} is one of the reasons why I got into astronomy), reading webcomics and practicing/learning the Korean language (안녕하세요! 만나서 반갑습니다 ㅎㅎ).
